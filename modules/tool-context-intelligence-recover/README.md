# context-intelligence-recover

`context-intelligence-recover` is a dedicated, durable recovery command for
native Context Intelligence captures. Version 0.2 uses a compact V2
checkpoint: one artifact row and one cursor per current destination, never an
event payload or per-event delivery row. It reads only:

```text
<root>/<project>/sessions/<session>/context-intelligence/events.jsonl
```

and the adjacent native metadata. It never uses the ordinary event endpoint.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install "amplifier-module-tool-context-intelligence-recover @ git+https://github.com/microsoft/amplifier-bundle-context-intelligence@main#subdirectory=modules/tool-context-intelligence-recover"
```

## Use

```bash
context-intelligence-recover --once
context-intelligence-recover --path ~/saved-captures --once
context-intelligence-recover --watch
context-intelligence-recover --dry-run
```

There are intentionally no server URL or credential flags. The command resolves
the effective hook configuration for each recorded working directory by merging
the user-level settings with that project's local settings. It applies the
hook's include/exclude matcher to the recorded working directory and fans
eligible records out to every matching destination. If that effective
configuration cannot be resolved safely, the artifact remains blocked. It first
requires the target's `native-recovery` version
capability; a target without it remains blocked and is never sent through an
ordinary event endpoint.

By default, checkpoints are private SQLite files under
`~/.local/state/context-intelligence/recovery/<job-id>/`. A job records facts
only in `<state-dir>/<job-id>.v2.sqlite3`; a private lock sidecar coordinates
runners. It never opens, migrates, removes, or changes an existing V1
`<job-id>.sqlite3`. The local JSON summary reports `legacy_checkpoint_present`
when that V1 file exists.

The checkpoint stores only source/metadata hashes and stat facts, record count,
native artifact facts, and compact source cursors (ordinal and byte offset).
Unchanged artifacts use their durable stat-and-hash snapshot; delivery reads
only the next bounded (16 MiB maximum) line through a verified descriptor. A
source or metadata stat change triggers one full rehash before delivery and
quarantines the artifact on mismatch. Event bodies are never persisted in the
checkpoint, and source paths are never sent to a target or emitted in local
summaries.
Use `--job-id` to resume the same job or `--state-dir` to place the checkpoint
elsewhere.
`--once` returns nonzero whenever deferred, blocked, or quarantined work
remains. `--watch` honors `Retry-After` before retrying and re-reads
configuration on each cycle.

`--dry-run` (also `--plan`) inventories and evaluates routing without issuing
any HTTP requests. Recovery scans only exact
`<project>/sessions/<session>/context-intelligence/events.jsonl` candidates,
streams them one binary line at a time, and retains invalid or unsafe captures
as explicit deferred/quarantined inventory states. Source artifacts are never
modified or deleted.

Each runner cycle submits at most one source record to a logical configured
destination. Logical destinations remain independent even if they share an
endpoint URL. A `202`
(including a duplicate acknowledgement) advances only that target's cursor.
Lost acknowledgements leave it unchanged, while `429` and transient `5xx`
responses defer the target. Authentication, missing capability, and unsupported
target responses block it; invalid/conflicting recovery responses quarantine the
current cursor while all other cursor state remains durable.
